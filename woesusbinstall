 **__How to install WoeUSB on a Debian/Ubuntu based system__**:
 
 »#First update and upgrade your system, and install a few needed packages:
 
 $ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt install devscripts equivs gdebi-core git
 
 » #Next, create a directory that we can build it in, and then change into that directory:
 
 $ mkdir ~/build && cd ~/build
 
 » #Now lets clone the git repo that we need, with the source for WoeUSB and change into that directory:
 
 $ git clone https://github.com/OMGdaDPS/WoeUSB.git && cd WoeUSB
 
 » #Run the provided script to set up the development environment:
 
 $ bash setup-development-environment.bash
 
 » #Now We Install WoeUSB's Dependencies:
 $ mk-build-deps
 
 » #Use `ls` to determine the version number (replace the <version> tag below with what is displayed):
 
 $ ls -ah
 
 » #Then finally install:
 
 $ sudo dpkg -i woeusb-build-deps_<version>_all.deb 
 #(hit tab after "deps" for autocomplete)
 
 »#Now we build the actual WoeUSB package:
 
 $ dpkg-buildpackage -uc -b
 
 #The .deb package for that we just built will be in the top level of the "build" directory.
 #Change into that directory and install it with `dpkg -i woeusb_<version>_<architecture>.deb`
 
 -----
 
 #Now that you have it installed, you have two choices: 
 #-Terminal 
 #-GUI
 
 #The terminal way is the easiest, fastest and safest way to do it.
 #Example:
 
 $ woeusb --device Windows7_x64.iso /dev/sdX
 
 #Another example:
 
 $ woeusb --device <source media path> <device>
 
 #If you are trying to install __Windows 10__ to the device, you need to specify the target filesystem with: '--tgt-fs NTFS'
 #Example:
 $ woeusb --device <source media path> <device> --tgt-fs NTFS
 #You will also need root, or sudo to flash to the disk.
