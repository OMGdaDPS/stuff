## A collection of things that I am working on or have finished, for everyone. Please use what you want!

#### Things that you will find here:
- Things that I believe are neccessary after an install, for my systems (probably written in a script of some sort)
- Custom settings for things like `.bashrc` and extensions.
- Tutorials and/or procedures/steps to install or make certain things.
- Etc




Things added | Description
------------ | -------------
Fancy Bash Prompt| Bash prompt from [Parrot OS](https://parrotlinux.org/)
WoeUSB install | How to install on Debian/Ubuntu based systems
BU USB Backup Tool| Amazingly simple way to back things up to USB!


## Todo:

- [ ] Need to figure out how to embed images into the README...
- [ ] Need to create and upload a script (bash) that will run all of the "after install" items.
- [ ] Learn more about markdown and HTML, to make this readme better.

#### Credits:

- BU Backup Tool is provided by EZEELINUX. Thanks!
- WoeUSB is a fork of Congelli501's WinUSB software, for which I have made a simplified and easy to read set of instructions for, and also will host the source for it until GitHub ceases to exist (hopefully never). Thanks!
