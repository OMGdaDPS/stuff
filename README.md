## This is just a place for me to upload stuff that I need to remember, and things like install scripts or custom settings, etc.

#### Things that you will find here:
- Things that I belive are neccessary after an install, for my systems (probably written in a script of some sort)
- Custom settings for things like `.bashrc` and extensions.
- Tutorials and/or procedures/steps to install or make certain things.
- Etc
